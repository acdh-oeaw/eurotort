        "situation": "On 24 June 1998, the non-profit-making organization Eglise universelle du Royaume de Dieu/Universele Kerk van het Rijk God (below “the Church”) and three natural persons (its president, its secretary and its treasurer) sued the Belgian State through the Chambre des représentants/Kamer van volksvertegenwoordigers, one of two Belgian federal legislative assemblies, represented by its president, before the court of first instance of Brussels with the aim of obtaining damages. They considered they had suffered damage caused by a faulty conduct of the parliamentary commission responsible for an investigation into sects. More precisely, they criticized the use of some words and sentences in the final written report established by the commission and (partially) voted by the legislative assembly. In the first instance, judges considered that the judicial suit was inadmissible. Therefore, the claimants appealed to the court of appeal. ",
        "motto": "Before the court of appeal, the claimants were successful. According to the court of appeal, the Belgian State breached the precautionary duty in writing the report. Indeed, one can read in it that the Church is apparently a criminal organization, the sole aim of which is its enrichment, that its activities are assimilated to swindling, that sexual scandals have happened within the organization, etc. Noting that the report was established by a parliamentary commission that holds powers similar to the powers of an examining magistrate, that the authors of the report alleged they had adopted an objective point of view and that the report was intended to be widely read by the public, the court of appeal considered that the parliamentary commission showed great negligence and great tactlessness and that this attitude constituted a tortious fault of the State: the State, embodied by the parliamentary commission, did not take into consideration the usual caution in writing public reports. Having considered that the State committed a fault, the court of appeal was of the opinion that the best way to compensate the damage resulting from the fault was to have its judgment partially published in newspapers. Indeed, according to the court of appeal, the report exposes the Church to public contempt. The certain and non-pecuniary damage caused by the fault was described by the court of appeal as being an attack against the social image of an association. ",
        "commentary": "The decision of the court of appeal was profusely commented upon in several newspapers as well as in legal journals. Some authors approved the decision founded on art. 1382 of the Civil Code; others disapproved of it. Briefly, it can be said that the authors who disapproved of the decision essentially based their criticism on art. 58 of the Constitution, exactly as the defendant (i.e. the Belgian State) did before the court of appeal. According to this art. 58, none of the natural persons forming the legislative assemblies may be sued on the occasion of opinions delivered or votes formulated in their functions. This art. 58 aims to insure each member of the Parliament a total freedom of speech and expression in the exercise of his/her function. This freedom, said an older public prosecutor, protects the national representation against the government, against the judicial power, against any of the authorities (other than the legislative assemblies) and against the particulars. The court of appeal did (obviously) not deny the existence of this total freedom which results from the Constitution but considered that the immunity of the natural members of Parliament did not constitute any obstacle to sue the State. According to the court of appeal, the liability of the Belgian State is not excluded because the liability of one of its bodies (i.e. the members of the Parliamentary commission) may not be invoked. According to Prof. Dr. M. Uyttendaele, this interpretation of art. 58 of the Constitution, which is new, is not admissible. This author is of the opinion that art. 58 creates a chain of exemptions of liability: The members of Parliament, then the parliamentary commissions and, finally, the Parliament itself are exempted from liability. This may be explained by the fact that the members of Parliament would no longer be totally free if they knew that the liability of third parties (such as the State) could be engaged owing to their opinion or to their vote. This author realises that this point of view could lead in certain circumstances to a lack of liability but this should be accepted for the benefit of the Parliament. Nevertheless, the author would be in favour of pushing aside the special protection provided by art. 58 when the freedom of speech and expression is used to put in jeopardy the foundations of the democracy that are precisely protected by the provision. Taking the opposite view, some authors approved the decision of the court of appeal. In summarizing all their points of view, one could say that these authors consider that the organ theory (théorie de l’organe/orgaantheorie) would apply. One recalls that an organ (organe/orgaan) is the natural person through which the legal person (private such as a company or public like the State) acts; the organ acts as if it were the legal person: a legal person may not act otherwise than through a natural person who is called the organ. Therefore, when an organ acted with fault, the liability of the legal person may be incurred directly on the basis of art. 1382 of the Civil Code. There is no question of vicarious liability: the acts performed by the natural person are regarded as having been performed by the legal person itself. Three authors at least consider that the decision of 28 June 2005 is justified under the organ theory. Prof. Dr. H. Vuye, for instance, who had already pleaded for the application of this theory in 1997, wrote once again that the theory may apply to the State for acts performed by the members of Parliament. It means concretely, according to this author, that under the organ theory the Belgian State may incur liability for faulty conduct of members of Parliament while these members personally do not incur any liability by application of art. 58 of the Constitution. By way of short conclusion, one may note that mathematically the authors who approved the decision of the court of appeal seem to form the majority. Nevertheless, one should not lose sight of the fact that the Belgian State, represented by the President of the Chambre des Représentants/Kamer van volksvertegenwoordigers, did not agree with the decision of the court of appeal and appealed to the Supreme Court. The case is therefore not really closed … ",

Three authors at least consider that the decision of 28 June 2005 is justified under the organ theory. Prof. Dr. H. Vuye, for instance, who had already pleaded for the application of this theory in 1997, wrote once again that the theory may apply to the State for acts performed by the members of Parliament. It means concretely, according to this author, that under the organ theory the Belgian State may incur liability for faulty conduct of members of Parliament while these members personally do not incur any liability by application of art. 58 of the Constitution. By way of short conclusion, one may note that mathematically the authors who approved the decision of the court of appeal seem to form the majority. Nevertheless, one should not lose sight of the fact that the Belgian State, represented by the President of the Chambre des Représentants/Kamer van volksvertegenwoordigers, did not agree with the decision of the court of appeal and appealed to the Supreme Court. The case is therefore not really closed … Freedom of the Members of the Parliament and Liability of the State 100",
