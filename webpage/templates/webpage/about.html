    <p>Eurotort database was first created in 2007 with the aim of making tort-related case law from European jurisdictions accessible to private law scholars and practitioners Europe- and worldwide. While many databases offer access to national court decisions, this access is usually limited both by language and by jurisdiction. Unlike them, Eurotort provides access to carefully selected case reports from most European legal systems in the English language. With a single search, the most important aspects of tort law can be investigated either in any one of the legal systems covered, or in a selection of countries, or without any geographical limitation. Each Database entry consists of a short summary of the case facts and the court decision, both provided by a tort law expert from the respective jurisdiction. Eurotort also offers information on other sources of information on the case in question, if available.</p>
    <p>The idea for Eurotort originated in the Vienna-based Institute for <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/etl/">European Tort Law (ETL)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ectil.org/">European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law (ECTIL)</a>. Both institutions have vast experience in comparative tort law and, among other projects, publish the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/etl/publications/european-tort-law-yearbook">European Tort Law Yearbook</a> series (both ETL and ECTIL) as well as the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/etl/publications/digest-of-european-tort-law-1">Digest of European Tort Law</a> series (ETL). Since 2001, the Yearbook provides an annual, comprehensive overview of the latest tort law developments in Europe. Renowned academics choose and report on the most relevant court decisions as well as legislative developments in the field of tort law in their respective jurisdictions. The Digest series <strong>compiles court decisions from almost all European jurisdictions concerning selected, fundamental aspects of tort law</strong>.</p>
    <p>Eurotort takes these cases online. Case reports from the Yearbook and the Digest series are continuously transferred to the Eurotort database, where they are categorised and indexed to make it intuitive to search them. Users can browse and filter through the case reports by legal systems, court names, decision dates, keywords, tags and other relevant criteria, or by a combination of these (see the <a href="{% url 'webpage:staticpage' template='search' %}">more detailed search information</a>).</p>
    <p>The creation of this database and an update in 2009 were made possible thanks to the support of the European Union under the Framework Programme for Judicial Cooperation in Civil Matters coordinated by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/index_en.htm">Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security of the European Commissio</a>n. For the complete reimplementation of Eurotort in 2025, ETL cooperated with the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/acdh-home">Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Until further notice, the use of the database is free of charge.</p>
